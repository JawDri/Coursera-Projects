In this hands-on project, we will train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets.
This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment
(i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not).
The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.
