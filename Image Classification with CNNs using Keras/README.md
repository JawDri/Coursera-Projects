Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

* Understand how to create convolutional neural networks in Keras.
* Be able to train convolutional neural networks to solve image classification problems.
By the end of this course, we will be able to create a CNN model in Keras from scratch, and use to solve image classification problems on your own data.
