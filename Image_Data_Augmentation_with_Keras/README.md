In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

* Image Data Augmentation with Keras.
* Use Image Data Generator with a Keras Model.

By the end of this course, you will be able to use Image Data Generators in Keras to augment and normalize your dataset, as well as be able to use Image Data Generators in model training.
