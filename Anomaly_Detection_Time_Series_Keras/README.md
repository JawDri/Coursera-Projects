In this hands-on introduction to anomaly detection in time series data with Keras,
we and I will build an anomaly detection model using deep learning. Specifically,
we will be designing and training an LSTM autoencoder using the Keras API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend to detect anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index.
We will also create interactive charts and plots using Plotly Python and Seaborn for data visualization and display our results in Jupyter notebooks.
