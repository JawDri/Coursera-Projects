In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

* Develop an understanding of weight regularization and dropout regularization.
* Be able to apply weight regularization and dropout regularization in TensorFlow and Keras.

By the end of this course, you will be able to apply regularization to a neural network model and reduce the difference between training and validation accuracy of the model on a given data-set.
