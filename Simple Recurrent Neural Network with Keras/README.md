In this hands-on project, we will use Keras with TensorFlow as its backend
to create a recurrent neural network model and train it to learn to perform addition of simple equations given in string format.
We will learn to create synthetic data for this problem as well. By the end of this 2-hour long project, we will have created, trained, and evaluated 
a sequence to sequence RNN model in Keras. Computers are already pretty good at math, so this may seem like a trivial problem, but itâ€™s not! We will give 
the model string data rather than numeric data to work with. 
This means that the model needs to infer the meaning of various characters from a sequence of text input and then learn addition from the given data.
