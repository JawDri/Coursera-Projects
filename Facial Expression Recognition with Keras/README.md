In this course, we are going to focus on four learning objectives:

* Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras
* Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)

By the end of this course, you will be able to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions.
